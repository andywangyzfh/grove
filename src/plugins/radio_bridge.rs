//! Plugin radio bridge — relays Grove's global [`RadioEvent`] stream into the
//! per-task plugin event channel as `grove:radio` events, so plugin panels
//! holding `chat:read` see the same aggregated ACP/agent activity (chat status,
//! busy transitions, prompts, final messages, hook notifications, todo
//! progress) that the Radio phone and menubar tray already consume.
//!
//! This deliberately rides the *already-aggregated* radio event bus rather than
//! the raw per-session `AcpUpdate` broadcast: the radio layer has done the work
//! of collapsing the firehose into semantic, task-grained events, which is
//! exactly the granularity a plugin wants.
//!
//! Only task-scoped events are forwarded; ambient global events (client count,
//! theme, group changes) have no task to attribute and are dropped.
